    <h1>Dan Brown - Inferno</h1> <img src="https://images3.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780804147989" alt="Dan Brown - Inferno (book)">
	<p>Dan Brown's fourth Robert Langdon book, Inferno, throws the clever professor into another complex mystery with global consequences. 
Langdon faces a scientist bent on destruction: a scientist who finds inspiration in Dante Alighieri's Inferno. Langdon awakes in a Venice hospital 
with no memory of how he got there. He has little time to collect his thoughts or make sense of the visions that tell him to "seek and find" before 
an assassin arrives. Langdon must set off to put the pieces together. This comprehensive review gives you a complete overview of the plot, 
key characters, and the author's writing style, both good and bad.</p>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Harvard professor Robert Langdon wakes up in a hospital in Florence, Italy with a head wound and no memory of the last few days. 
Dr. Sienna Brooks, one of the doctors tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia. When Vayentha, a female assassin, shows up in the hospital and kills Dr. Marconi, 
Brooks helps Langdon escape, and they flee to her apartment. After Brooks recounts the details of his admission to the hospital, Langdon finds a cylinder with a biohazard sign in 
his jacket and decides to call the U.S. consulate. He is told that they are searching for him and want his location. Per Brooks' guidance, he gives them a location across the street 
from her apartment to avoid getting Brooks more involved in his mysterious situation than she already is. Soon, Langdon sees Vayentha pull up to the location he gave the consulate. 
At this point, they both believe the U.S. government wants to kill him. Langdon then decides to open the container and finds a small medieval bone cylinder fitted with a hi-tech 
projector that displays a modified version of Botticelli's Map of Hell, which is based on Dante's Inferno. A trail of clues leads them toward the Old City.</p>
